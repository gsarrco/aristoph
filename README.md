# Aristoph
Aristoph was a school & course management platform developed by myself for the Aristofane high school (Liceo Aristofane) in Rome, Italy, from 2015 to 2020.

It enables the registration of extracurricular activities (language courses, labs, remedian courses), with booking and presence system; parent-teacher conferences; teachers' timetable preferences; satisfaction questionnaires.

The project is not active anymore and I have not prepared it to make it a plug-and-play software. It is more of an archival version, and hopefully it will get some love in the future.
